# Cranking Vectors

Fun with embeddings and vector math.

Using embedding model from OpenAI, do some vector similarity math.

Using an OpenAI embedding model hosted on Azure OpenAI, use Semantic Kernel in C# on .NET 9 to programatically (a) use API to create an embedding vector for the string "King of England" then the string "Queen of England" then calculate cosine similarity.
